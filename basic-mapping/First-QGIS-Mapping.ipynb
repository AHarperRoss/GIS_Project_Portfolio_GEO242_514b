Normally in Google docs, I just have to go along with whatever formatting they decide to give me, but here I can just make it myself. It did take me a little while to figure out what did what. And the lines of markdown script were a little intimidating to see at first, before I knew what all of them meant.\n",

        "    - Again, because I can control everything about what is on my doc, it was nice to see what I was making. Also the coding bar and the preview bar side by side really helped with seeing how everything was coming out, so I didn't have to double check all the time. Even before I had the markdown language figured out, it was easy to mess with things to see what they did. I used this to figure out what most things like the `*` and the `#` did before we went over them in class."
